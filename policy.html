    <h1>Privacy Policy for Suvenir</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 07/12/2025 (dd/mm/aaaa)</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Suvenir is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use our application.
        Our app processes your media files locally on your device and does not upload them to external servers. However, the app uses a third-party service (Google AdMob) to display advertisements.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Our application accesses and processes images and media files stored on your device. This is done solely to provide the app's core functionality, such as managing and organizing your media files.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access to Storage:</strong> The app requests permissions to read and write to your device's storage. This access is necessary to:
            <ul>
                <li>Allow you to view and manage your images.</li>
                <li>Save modifications or changes made to your media files.</li>
                <li>Enable features such as moving images between folders or deleting them upon your request.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your media files never leave your device and are not shared with any external service.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Processing</h2>
    <p>
        All operations on your images and files occur locally on your device. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your images and files never leave your device.</li>
        <li>No media content is transmitted or stored outside your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, the app uses a third-party advertising service, which may collect certain device information for ad personalization, analytics, and fraud prevention.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        To provide its functionality, the app requires the following permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read External Storage:</strong> To access and display the images and files stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Write External Storage:</strong> To modify, move, or delete media files upon your request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used exclusively for the app's core features and nothing else.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Suvenir uses the following third-party service:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used to display advertisements within the app.
            Google AdMob may collect device and usage information such as:
            <ul>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)</li>
                <li>App interactions (e.g., when ads are viewed)</li>
                <li>General location information</li>
            </ul>
            This data is used for:
            <ul>
                <li>Serving personalized or non-personalized ads</li>
                <li>Analytics and ad performance measurement</li>
                <li>Fraud prevention</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Suvenir itself does not collect, store, or transmit personal data. Any data collected by AdMob is handled according to Google's policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Suvenir does not collect or store personal data. However, because AdMob may collect certain information, you may exercise your rights (such as opting out of personalized ads) through your device settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        <li>On iOS: Settings → Privacy → Tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the app and will include an updated "Effective Date."
